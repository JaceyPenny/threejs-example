# AM3 Cooperative 3D Simulator | Three.JS

This repository contains a sample web application that loads and renders AM3 Bots and simulation files produced by the AM3 chunking/slicing software.

## Some instructions

1. You'll need `webpack` and `npx` on your CLI. To install that, just run `npm i webpack-cli -g` and `npm install npx`.
2. To install the dependencies for the app, run `npm install`. Make sure to do this before starting the application
3. To serve the app on `localhost:8080`, run the command `npm start`
    - You may need to install `http-server` first. If so, run `npm i http-server -g`

That's it! You should be able to open your browser to `localhost:8080` and see the basic simulator.
